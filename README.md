Hello, I'm Abayomi, a programmer and entrepreneur with a passion for business development. I specialise in distributed systems, back-end architecture, and cloud infrastructure.

When I'm not hands-on setting the technology strategy and ensuring intense execution for fintech startups in Lagos, you can find me working remotely.

Previously Director of Engineering at Dot, a Lagos-based startup democratising financial services by providing digital banking tools for underserved consumers in emerging markets.
