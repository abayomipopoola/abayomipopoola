My name is Abayomi, a programmer and entrepreneur with a passion for business development. I'm a results-oriented engineer specializing in designing and building highly scalable, resilient, and distributed systems.

When I'm not hands-on setting the technology strategy and ensuring intense execution for fintech startups in Lagos, you can find me working remotely.

Most recently, I was the Director of Engineering at Dot, a Lagos-based startup democratising financial services by providing digital banking tools for underserved consumers in emerging markets.
