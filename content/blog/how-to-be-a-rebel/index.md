The whiff of coffee quickened me to a whole new possibilities this beautiful morning.

A couple of chapters from a beautiful book top the excitement and assurance of waking up to the contrary of yet another morning.

Reading gives new perspective to life—let you see the world from an author’s eye, challenges your perceptions, gives you hope,
wakes you from a dogma and so much more. About 26 books a year should be the goal of a busy person—say you’re reading one every
two weeks.

So what did I learn today? I learned **“How to be a Rebel”**, I learned that humans are in constant rebellion against failure and
unhappiness. That is good. It indicates a desire for freedom.

But because of unclear thinking, most men utterly waste their power
of healthy rebellion. In brief, a man rebels against the wrong things. By directing his protests against exterior conditions he
misses the point entirely. It is not his exterior world that needs his attention; it is himself.

A man falls into a self-made trap whenever he thinks that by replacing his politics or his sex partner or residence or religion
that he has really changed anything. In truth, he has merely replaced one prison cell to another—and deep down in his heart he desperately knows it. But by not facing
that truth, he is desperately driven to Rebel again and again against some exterior condition—with the same empty results.
What, then, should we Rebel against? What is the logical and profitable target?

We have one thing and one thing only to Rebel against: Our own negative or unrealistic or unworkable state of mind.
In that is complete freedom, and in no place else.
When a man makes right his mental processes, every exterior condition effortlessly right itself!
