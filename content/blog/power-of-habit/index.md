9-5 embraces me like I have the choice of refuting its warmth. I kinda miss work though, I’ve been off lately.

Humans naturally are lazy... if there were to be a new religion that preaches slothfulness, I’m certain the congregation would be filled up in no time. It’s the way our brains are wired--inertia.

Recently, scientists have discovered a nub of neurological tissue known as the basal ganglia. If you picture the human brain as an onion, composed of layer upon layer of cells, then the outside layer, the closest to the scalp--are generally the most recent addition from an evolutionary perspective.

So what’s​ this basal ganglia thing all about and how does it relate here? This tissue is what is responsible for recalling patterns and acting on them. The basal ganglia stores habit even while the rest of the brain went to sleep.

The basal ganglia, according to Duhigg’s book--**The Power of Habit**, is where patterns are stored and are accessed in a manner that gives the mind an opportunity to ramp down or perform tasks that require more mental capacity. These patterns are accessed via chunking. This is where the mind identifies which automatic pattern (habit) to use based on perceived cues. Once a cue is identified the conscious mind then triggers the associated habit before relaxing until the stored behavioral pattern is complete. Then the mind ramps back up at the end to insure that the automatic behavior it initiated produced the desired result/reward. I personally refer to the basal ganglia as our internal puppet master.

In our daily lives, we often physically manipulate objects--let's say you're about to leave for work after having your bath; you put on a shirt, button it, wear your shoes, tie the shoelaces, open the door, walk out, close the door, lock the door, and walk to your car. Such a daily routine consists of a sequence of many movements--patterns. These patterns have been acquired through long-term learning and can be performed automatically without conscious attention. In fact, our daily routines consist of a variety of automatic actions in form of patterns. Without such automatic action skills, we would spend an enormous amount of time and energy before approaching a goal. Animals also naturally develop a variety of action skills after long-term learning. No matter how complex the endeavour might be.

So in conclusion, let’s continue fighting the concept of inertia till the basal ganglia takes over any complex endeavours, and every hard routine becomes a habit.
