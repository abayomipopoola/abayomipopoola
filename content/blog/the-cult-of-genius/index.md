![Cult of genius](./cult.png)

We do not ask how it came to be. Instead, we rejoice in the present fact as though it came out of the ground by magic. -- Nietzsche

Our vanity, our self-love, promotes the cult of the genius... for if we think of genius as something magical, we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking. To call someone ‘divine’ means, “here, there’s no need to compete”. In other words, mythologizing natural talent lets us all off the hook. It lets us relax into the status quo.

Nietzsche implored us to consider exemplars to be above all else, craftsmen: “Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. They acquired greatness -- became geniuses. They all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman who first learns to construct the parts properly before they ventures to fashion a great whole; they allow themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole.
