Regression analysis is a commonly used tool in scientific and statistical research. However, many people may not understand what it is and how it works. Simply put, regression analysis is a method used to measure the relationship between two or more variables, and to establish correlations between them.

### Correlation

Correlation is a statistical concept that indicates whether two variables, x and y, move together. If they change at a constant rate, they are positively correlated. For example, it tends to be cold when it snows. Conversely, if they move in opposite directions, they are negatively correlated, such as rain and sunshine.

When dealing with a large dataset containing many variables, regression analysis can be used to help sort out the data. This is achieved by holding all variables except the ones of interest constant and demonstrating how they co-vary. For example, imagine a dataset that measures students' academic performance in public schools in Surulere LGA. This dataset contains variables such as gender, family structure, socioeconomic status, parents' education level, and more.

To make sense of this complex data, we can think of regression analysis as converting each Surulere LGA student into a circuit board with an equal number of switches. Each switch represents a category of data, such as primary one math score, primary four math score, primary one reading score in English language, mother's education level, father's income, neighborhood affluence, and so on.

By doing this, a researcher can begin to identify patterns and relationships within the data. They can group students who share many characteristics, based on their circuit board switches that are flipped in the same direction, and then pinpoint a single characteristic that they don't share. This allows the researcher to understand the effect of that characteristic, and eventually, the effect of every switch in the circuit board.

### Correlation is not causation

Let's consider an example to understand the limitations of regression analysis. Suppose we want to gain insights about the relationship between parenting and education by analyzing whether having a lot of books at home results in better academic performance for children. While regression analysis can show whether there is a correlation between these two variables, it cannot establish causality. In other words, it can tell us whether children with more books tend to perform better academically than those without books, but it cannot prove that having more books is the cause of better academic performance.

Therefore, while regression analysis is a valuable tool for identifying connections between variables, it is important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. Further investigation, careful studies, and critical thinking are necessary to establish cause and effect relationships.
