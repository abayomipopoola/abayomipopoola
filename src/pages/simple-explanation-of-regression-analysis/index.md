Regression analysis is a ubiquitous tool of scientific/statistical research, but what is it and how can it be explained simply? It's safe to define it as a method of measuring the link between two or more phenomena--establishing a correlation between phenomena.

#### Correlation

Correlation is nothing more than a statistical term that indicates whether two variables, x and y, move together--how closely related two sets of data are. It tends to be cold when it snows--positive correlation; rain and sunshine, on the other hand, are negatively correlated.

So what happens when weâ€™ve got more variables, say a couple of hundred variables, things get a little bit harder. You guessed it, we employ ***Regression Analysis*** to help sort out the huge piles of data.

This is made possible by artificially holding constant every variable except the two we wish to focus on, then showing how the two co-vary. For example, imagine an arbitrary set of data that measured students' academic performance of public schools in Surulere LGA, and gathered information about each child: his gender, family structure, socioeconomic status, the level of his parents' education, etc. With respect to this data, it might help to think of regression analysis as performing the following tasks: converting each of those Surulere students into a sort of a circuit board with an identical number of switches. Each switch represents a single category of the child's data: his primary one math score, his primary four math score, his primary one reading score in english language, his mother's education level, his father's income, the relative affluence of his neighborhood, and so on.

Now a researcher is able to tease some insights from this very complicated set of data. He can line up all the children who share many characteristics--all the circuit board that has their switches flipped in the same direction--and then pinpoint a single characteristic they don't share. This is how the effect of that switch--and, eventually, of every switch--becomes manifested.

#### Asking data questions 

Let's say we want to ask the Surulere data a fundamental question about parenting and education: does having a lot of books in your home (assuming it's part of the data collected) lead your child to do well in school? Regression analysis can't quite answer that question but it can answer a subtly different one: does a child with a lot of books in his home tend to do better than a child with no books? The difference between the first and second is the difference between causality (question 1) and correlation (question 2).

A regression analysis can demonstrate correlation, but it doesn't prove cause. It helps establish the existence of connections that call for a closer investigation of careful studies and critical thinking.
