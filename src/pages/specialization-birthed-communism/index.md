Karl Marx got tired of the ‘concept of specialization’ that the Scottish economist, philosopher and author, Adam Smith, preached and asked himself that why should he do the same thing for the most part of his adult life just because it increases throughput and enriches private enterprises?

All Adam smith cared about was private enterprise and free trade. What if I don’t care about all that?

I’ve got a conjecture on how the communism thing came to be.

...

I believe Marx realizes he can’t live a carefree life without money, thus he’ll have to embrace Smith’s idea that the society had embodied. I guess he struggled with the idea and got tired of the banalities the concept brings with it. So he sat down, and got lost in his own thought, and there you have it, the eureka moment.

What if I preach a political theory that favors collectivism (giving a group priority over each individual) in a classless society? What if people own the means of production by abolishing private ownership?

Marx continues to tinker on his newly created ideology, and as fate would have it—Friedrich Engels, his contemporary also shares the same ideology. In 1848, they wrote and publish a book, titled: The Communist Manifesto.

In the book, they painted the business owners as the bad guys—call them exploiters of workers and whatnot.... People took to it and the rest as we know it, is history (read more here: stanford.io/2omgZzx).
