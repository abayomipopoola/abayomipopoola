Your personality will partially determine how good you are at your job, especially if your job requires more than rote behavior. So are you and your job a good fit? Creative people prefer jobs that allow them to try new things--***openness***--one of the 'Big Five personality traits'; these guys are more likely to succeed at jobs that require novel solutions over efficient ones. On the contrary, some people are ***conscientious***--another 'Big Five personality trait', and they're likely to be better off in a management or administrative position.

This article is based on a BigThink video by Jordan Peterson; he started by suggesting a job categorisation scheme that’s rather general.

#### Simplified Job Categorisation

So the first dimension of Peterson's categorisation is complexity. Jobs range from simple to complex. A simple job is one that you can learn and then repeat. You don’t need high levels of cognitive function for a simple job. If you have high levels of cognitive function you’ll learn the job faster, but once you learn it you won’t necessarily do it better.

A complex job on the other hand is one where the requirements change on an ongoing basis. So most managerial and executive jobs are like that in that they requires a high level of general cognitive ability. That’s the best predictor of success in complex jobs. So that’s axis number one of the category.

Axis number two is creative/entrepreneurial versus managerial/administrative. For creative/entrepreneurial jobs you need people who are high in the personality trait “openness to experience,” Big Five personality trait that’s associated with lateral and divergent thinking. Which are the creative types.

And for managerial/administrative bit, whose jobs are more algorithmic--so imagine the guardrails. You’re a train on a track and you want to go down the track fast. You don’t have to be creative to go down a track (that’s already laid down) fast. You have to be conscientious. And so the best personality predictor for managerial and administrative jobs is trait “conscientiousness”.

#### Organisations headache

Let's say your organisation already has a laid plan on how to achieve a goal, what you need is conscientious people. Because if you know what you’re doing you should just do it as efficiently as you can. But the problem you'll face is that the world changes around you unexpectedly. And so if you don’t have people who can think divergently when the marketplace shifts on you--which it most certainly will--then you don’t have anybody who can figure out where to lay new tracks. Now it’s really, really difficult for people, for corporations to get the balance between the entrepreneurial/creative types and the managerial/administrative types correct.

Peterson thinks that what eventually happens--although research on this isn’t clear yet--What seems to happen is that when a company originates, the creative/entrepreneurial types predominate, and they have to be flexible and move laterally to get the company established to begin with and take risks and break rules and do all sorts of things that conscientious people are much less likely to be able to tolerate (let alone think up).
But as the company establishes itself the managerial/administrative types pour in and take over. But if they take over too much then the company gets so rigid it has no flexibility.

#### Measuring creativity

There's a measurement instrument called the creative achievement questionnaire which is very widely used in creativity research. What it does is it breaks down creativity into 13 dimensions, viz., visual arts (painting, sculpture), music, dance, individual sports (tennis, golf), team sports, architectural design, entrepreneurial ventures, creative writing, humor, inventions, scientific inquiry, theater and film, culinary arts. 

You imagine the 13 potential dimensions of creativity. And then it ranks order levels of creativity from “Zero, I have no training or talent in this area,” to “Ten, I have an international reputation in this area.”

And then the scores are plotted. The plotted distribution doesn't show a normal distribution, in fact sixty percent of the people who take the creative achievement questionnaire score zero. A tiny minority have high scores, giving a pareto distribution. It’s a classic distribution of human productivity. So you always get a pareto distribution, not a normal distribution when you’re talking about productivity. Creative people are a distinct minority. They’re a different kind of person, and they’re a pain. They’re a pain because you can’t evaluate them. Like how do you evaluate a creative person? They keep changing the rules of evaluation! So they’re a handful to manage, and they’re always trying to play a new game.

#### Capitalism

So there’s this terrible tension in organizations, and Peterson thinks what generally happens is all the creative people that are there at the beginning--get chased out until you have nothing but managers and administrators. Then the environment shifts, then the company dies. And so the way that capitalism solves the problem of the tension between the creative types and the managerial types is it just lets companies die.

Now you might think, “Well I don’t want my company to die.” Of course, who would? So you need to understand the difference between these two kinds of people--which you probably won’t and you probably won’t admit to even if you knew. And then you have to figure out how to get the balance right. And that’s extraordinarily complicated.
