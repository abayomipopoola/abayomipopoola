Just like programming a computerâ€”as the program comes to the electrical computer from without; the same is true of each biological computers (the human brains): Purpose comes to it from outside its own mechanism.

> The mind programs the brain ðŸ§  .

One could posit that the mind is a separate but closely related element of the brain, contrary to the idea that itâ€™s merely a function of the brain. This could be backed by with scientific findings that could be surmised, viz., in the brain thereâ€™s an amazing automatic sensory and motor computer that utilizes the conditioned reflexesâ€”taking them as input signals for processing.

But humans are more than that...we possess some sort of a higher brain mechanism that is closely related to what weâ€™ve come to know as consciousness or spirit or the mind.

The fact that youâ€™re aware of spending time to read this article is simply what 'consciousness' is about.

Now that the mind can be seen as a separateâ€”although still very related to the brain, perhaps changing ones mindset could be a way of reprogramming the brain (Google the â€˜CIA MK ultraâ€™ programme for a start...the whole cybernetics field of study and stuff are pretty mind boggling).

The mind though, must be a very powerful thingâ€”having an energy of its own, that scientists canâ€™t explain, yet.
