In recent years, new members are joining the bitcoin/altcoins and blockchain technology community, not for an ideological reason but for practical ones.

Whether or not bitcoin will be worth millions isn’t the main question for many computer scientists, investors, and hackers, to them Satoshi Nakamoto’s real invention is the Blockchain Technology—a global open ledger which can be used to share much more than just money.

Bitcoin isn’t just another way to pay for items online, rather it's a denomination used to pave the tool to put stuff on a global ledger. Timestamp recordings of birth/death, properties, financial transactions, votes, etc., make up the entire fabric of our civilisation—which makes the Blockchain one of the most profound human innovation of our time. Because having a massive global ledger as a public utility can completely reorganise the way we run our society.

You see, one of the problems we have in an increasingly globalised system is that everyone is operating their systems on their own local standard, and getting people to do everything in a uniform way, that benefits all of us: like bringing in the metric system—is really hard. Blockchain offers an opportunity to start new exciting technological industries from a standard that is globalised and potentially uniform.

#### Bitcoin

Bitcoins is a stateless, “algorithmic” currency that exists only in cyberspace.

It all started in October 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto, a software engineer who was never identified, published a paper outlining a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”.

Like precious metals are dug from the earth, bitcoins are mined from blocks. Blocks are ledgers that contain a complex mathematical problem that, if solved, will reward its solvers with a number of bitcoins. 

> There’re only twenty-one million bitcoins to be mined.

Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin’s public ledger of past transactions, called the blockchain (chain of blocks)—a shared public ledger on which the entire decentralised distributed peer-to-peer Bitcoin network relies. All the Bitcoin used in the world are connected and together they constitute a network that processes and check all bitcoin transactions in a public ledger. 

Satoshi Nakamoto designed the Blockchain in such a way that users can create a free and anonymous bitcoin account number—a wallet. This eliminates the need for a central bank because all the users constitute the bank.


> A decentralised blockchain makes it possible to share data publicly without a single party controlling the system.

#### Banking system vs Bitcoin 

Modern paper currencies are fiat currencies, and we all know that the fiat monetary system is flawed.

Historically, the government would mint coins out of valuable materials, such as gold or silver, or print paper money that could be redeemed for a set amount of gold or silver. 

Because fiat money is not linked to physical reserves, such as a national stockpile of gold or silver, it risks losing value due to inflation or even becoming worthless in the event of hyperinflation—Zimbabwe as a perfect example.

Although if you created an entire society that is reliant on bitcoin, you’d have massive inequalities, it’s imperative that it forms a counterpart to the existing banking system—that bank on the fiat monetary system.

Right now, the banking system has moved to the concept of cashless-society, meaning that every single payment you make goes via a commercial bank—so every single transaction is being monitored and recorded in a database. And you’ll always pay some kind of fees to the commercial banks/credit card companies.

Bitcoin made the cashless society possible without the need for a third -party.

#### Blockchain

Let's say you started a coffee business with one shop, and you've got a Google Sheet template on your computer, detailing your coffee business transactions (a ledger). Later, you expanded and opened fifteen more shops. So you copied the Google Sheet template to the other shops' computer, and connected them, thereby forming a network of a distributed ledger. If there is a technology that updates the Google Sheet in the first shop whenever any of the other shops update their sheet. That technology would be a Blockchain.

> The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.” 
> – Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016).

Blockchain technology brings everyone to the highest degree of accountability. With the help of this technology no more transactions will be missed, human or machine errors will be minimised. 

We've seen major banks, e-commerce giants and other industries experimenting with blockchain for money transfers, keeping records, and other complex backend functions. As an un-alterable ledger in real time, it enables them to track documentation and authenticate ownership of assets digitally.

Just like all good things, Blockchain too has got some challenges: it requires high computing resources/power to operate; and in the case of bitcoin/altcoins, it's important you secure your wallet ID, as revealing it to a third party means losing control over your coin value, and also, if you forget your wallet ID it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are lost forever.
